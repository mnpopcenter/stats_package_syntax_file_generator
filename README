This gem produces statistical package syntax files for fixed-column data files.

    SAS
    SPSS
    Stata
    Stat/Transfer STS metadata files
    R (via the ripums package which depends on IPUMS DDIs)

Metadata can be supplied to the Controller in two general ways:

    - Programmatically, using the API provided by the Controller class.
      
    - Via one or more YAML files -- typically just one YAML file, but the 
      Controller will accept multiple files and merge their content.


Basic usage:

    require 'stats_package_syntax_file_generator'
    
    # Supply metadata via one YAML file.
    sfc = SyntaxFile::Controller.new(:yaml_files => 'metadata.yaml')

    # Or via multiple YAML files.
    sfc = SyntaxFile::Controller.new(:yaml_files => ['md1.yaml', 'md2.yaml'])

    # Or programmatically.
    # For a working example, see devel/api_example.rb.
    
    # Generate all syntax files.
    sfc.generate_syntax_files
    
    # Generate a syntax file of a specific TYPE (spss, sas, stata).
    sfc.generate_syntax_file('TYPE')
    
    # Ditto, but get the syntax as a list of strings rather than writing a file.
    syntax_lines = sfc.syntax('TYPE')

Class overview:

    Controller

        - The API for the gem. Users of the gem should not need to interact with
          other classes.

        - Serves as a container for the metadata needed to generate syntax files.

        - Holds various attributes specifying the type of syntax files to
          generate, the structure of the data files, and so forth.

    Variable
    Value

        - Metadata classes holding information about variables in the data file.

        - A Controller contains 1+ Variable objects.

        - A Variable contains 0+ Value objects.

    Maker
    Maker_SAS
    Maker_SPSS
    Maker_STATA
    Maker_STS
    Maker_RDDI

        - Classes responsible for creating syntax.

        - Maker provides methods that all classes have in common.

        - The other classes inherit from Maker, overriding behavior as needed.



General behavior of the specific Maker classes:

    - The classes all define a primary method: syntax().

    - The syntax() method consists of calls to various other methods responsible
      for generating sections of the syntax.

    - Methods that generate sub-sections of syntax have names beginning with 'syn_'.

    - All of the syntax-generating methods return a list of strings.


Notes on STS files:

    1.  Hierchical data.
        Stat/Transfer does not directly support hierarchical data structures. The
        workaround is to perform multiple invocations of Stat/Transfer, once per record 
        type. Each invocation must instruct Stat/Transfer to perform case selection to
        filter the records such that a single record type is in scope, and must request
        the variables appropriate for that record type.

    2.  Variable and value labels with quotes.  
        Stat/Transfer does not support escaping quotes within value labels.  Therefore,
        double quotes are represented by a pair of single quotes.

    3.  Only alphanumeric values are permitted for value labels.
        Nonconforming values are skipped, with a comment added to the STS file that
        documents this action.
